    <td>Ujjwal Swami</td>
    <td>This article covers codecs and containers. The author stresses that these are two very different concepts that should not be confused. He does still explain how they tie into each other, and in the high-speed streaming age it is understandable how one can get them confused. It goes into how codecs are meant for video compression/decompression, while containers are meant for keeping all of the data together. One of the best things about this article is the helpful table that explains which codecs are compatible with which containers. While the rest of the article can be described as basic information, the table can be used by beginner filmmakers and experts alike. </td>
